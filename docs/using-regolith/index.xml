This can make the first time experience a bit confusing. However using the Regolith interface is relatively simple by only committing the following two keybindings to memory:
Action Keybinding Purpose Keybinding Viewer super shift ? View and execute available keybindings App Launcher super space Launch a desktop application The Super Key # Most keybindings you&amp;rsquo;ll be using with Regolith start with the super key.</description></item><item><title>Basic Usage</title><link>https://regolith-desktop.com/docs/using-regolith/basics/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://regolith-desktop.com/docs/using-regolith/basics/</guid><description>Usage # Launch an Application # After the first login, the screen will contain a bar at the bottom and some keyboard shortcuts in a dialog. This dialog, ilia, provides assistance for finding keybindings for various actions in the desktop environment. It may be dismissed with the esc key and invoked again with super shift ? . To launch an application, press super space and a similar dialog will load with the applications installed on the system.</description></item><item><title>Configuration</title><link>https://regolith-desktop.com/docs/using-regolith/configuration/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://regolith-desktop.com/docs/using-regolith/configuration/</guid><description>Recommended Packages for New Users # Looks # Install all of the official Regolith looks:
sudo apt install regolith-look-* NOTE: this pulls in many fonts and some graphics resources so for users looking to minimize disk usage, uninstalling looks that are unused is recommended.
Status Indicators # The following snippet installs status indicator packages recommended for new users:
sudo apt install i3xrocks-focused-window-name i3xrocks-rofication i3xrocks-info i3xrocks-app-launcher i3xrocks-memory To remove any of these indicators later, simply uninstall them from your system.</description></item></channel></rss>

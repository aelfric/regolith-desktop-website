These are loaded alphabetically. Then user configurations in ~/.config/regolith2/i3/config.d are loaded, also in alphabetical order. Regolith&amp;rsquo;s default configuration is built to be customized by setting Xresources variables, adding user configuration, and adding or removing default configurations via apt. For this reason, there are several approaches to customization of i3 in Regolith that can be used separately or in combination to achieve your configuration cleanly:</description></item><item><title>Assign a workspace to a specific Output (Display)</title><link>https://regolith-desktop.com/docs/howtos/workspace-on-output/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://regolith-desktop.com/docs/howtos/workspace-on-output/</guid><description>NOTICE: This page was copied from the Regolith 1.x website and has not been updated for Regolith 2.

It may contain out of date information. Regolith ships with a notification system called Rofication. It is designed to work in the background and not use pop-ups as a way of alerting the user to a new notification. Rather, a small bar item displays the current number of unread notifications and a dialog can activated to interact with the content of the current notifications.</description></item><item><title>Change the Bar Date and Time Format</title><link>https://regolith-desktop.com/docs/howtos/time-format/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://regolith-desktop.com/docs/howtos/time-format/</guid><description>NOTICE: This page was copied from the Regolith 1.x website and has not been updated for Regolith 2.

Find package via the command line # The apt command can be used to query installed or all packages:
$ apt list --installed &amp;lt;package name&amp;gt; # finds installed packages $ apt list &amp;lt;package name&amp;gt; # finds all packages For example, to list all official Regolith looks that could be installed, run:</description></item><item><title>Customize Compositor</title><link>https://regolith-desktop.com/docs/howtos/customize-compositor/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://regolith-desktop.com/docs/howtos/customize-compositor/</guid><description>How to customize your compositor (visual effects) # Pay special attention to this section if you are experiencing odd visual glitches or slow graphics performance. A compositor is a UI component that applies visual effects to windows before they are rendered on-screen. Many desktop environments integrate a compositor directly into the window manager, making it difficult to switch out or disable. In Regolith, the compositor is defined as a pluggable “extension point” in the packaging system.</description></item><item><title>How to Hide i3-bar by default</title><link>https://regolith-desktop.com/docs/howtos/hide-i3-bar-by-default/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://regolith-desktop.com/docs/howtos/hide-i3-bar-by-default/</guid><description>NOTICE: This page was copied from the Regolith 1.x website and has not been updated for Regolith 2.

This approach produces a minimal setup as many of the standard GNOME desktop packages present in a desktop install will be avoided.
Steps # 1. Install Ubuntu Server # Follow online instructions for installing a fresh copy of Ubuntu Server versions either 20.04 or 22.04.
2. Add Regolith&amp;rsquo;s package key and apt repository # Once Ubuntu Server has been installed, log into a terminal session.</description></item><item><title>Override Xresources</title><link>https://regolith-desktop.com/docs/howtos/override-xres/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://regolith-desktop.com/docs/howtos/override-xres/</guid><description>Regolith relies on the Xresources system to provide a consolidated interface configuration. By changing Xresources values, Regolith can be customized in ways such as updating the user interface, specifying custom behaviors, or defining a specific format for some of the blocklets on the bar.
In Regolith, Xresources values can be changed via two methods: supplying your own Xresources files, and overriding the existing Xresources values. The latter approach is strongly recommended, as it makes upgrading to newer versions of Regolith less likely to break your customizations.</description></item><item><title>Remove Unneeded Dependencies</title><link>https://regolith-desktop.com/docs/howtos/remove-unneeded-deps/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://regolith-desktop.com/docs/howtos/remove-unneeded-deps/</guid><description>When Regolith is installed via ISO, only the necessary desktop components or packages are installed by default. However when installing Regolith into an existing Ubuntu system, some desktop components that Regolith does not require will still be installed on the system. There is nothing wrong with keeping these additional packages, in fact they are important if you wish to switch back to the default Ubuntu session at some point, however some users prefer to remove them.</description></item><item><title>Stage Config Files</title><link>https://regolith-desktop.com/docs/howtos/stage-configs/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://regolith-desktop.com/docs/howtos/stage-configs/</guid><description>If you only wish to override or provide new Xresources values, staging configs is not required and not recommended. Overriding Xresources value is described in a separate article. Regolith uses a number of configuration files to determine the behavior and look of various components. While it&amp;rsquo;s possible to simply edit these files directly, users who do so run the risk of having their configurations overwritten upon future updates. The Debian packaging system should ask users if they wish to take updates or keep the existing files, but this may have unintended side effects if users take partial updates of files.</description></item><item><title>Support Multiple Batteries</title><link>https://regolith-desktop.com/docs/howtos/multiple-batteries/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://regolith-desktop.com/docs/howtos/multiple-batteries/</guid><description>NOTICE: This page was copied from the Regolith 1.x website and has not been updated for Regolith 2. It may contain out of date information. Out of the box the primary battery status will be displayed in the i3-bar. For some laptops that have multiple batteries, e.g. ThinkPads, you want to have both batteries displayed:
Stage your i3xrocks configuration files, then open ~/.config/regolith2/i3xrocks/conf.d/80_battery in your editor of choice. Find the line that pertains to the battery blocklet: # Battery indicator # # Displays total percentage charge left of specified battery.</description></item><item><title>Verify behavior against upstream</title><link>https://regolith-desktop.com/docs/howtos/gnome-flashback-session/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://regolith-desktop.com/docs/howtos/gnome-flashback-session/</guid><description>NOTICE: This page was copied from the Regolith 1.x website and has not been updated for Regolith 2. It may contain out of date information. Regolith is composed of several existing open-source projects plus some additional custom packages. Sometimes when a bug is found in Regolith, actually it&amp;rsquo;s a bug in an upstream project. Determining the source of bugs is a first step in getting them fixed.
Check gnome-flashback # Most of Regolith&amp;rsquo;s GNOME support comes from the gnome-flashback project.</description></item></channel></rss>

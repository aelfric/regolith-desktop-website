# The Regolith Desktop Environment

![](/regolith-empty.png)

{{< columns >}}

### Productivity First

Regolith runs [i3](https://i3wm.org/): a popular, fast, and configurable tiling window manager which
is great for fast keyboard-driven workflows.  Regolith integrates i3 with other desktop components such as 
`i3bar`, `rofication`, `gnome-flashback`, and [`ilia`](https://github.com/regolith-linux/ilia#readme) to provide a complete desktop interface.

<--->

### GNOME System Management

By providing a gnome session with [`gnome-flashback`](https://wiki.gnome.org/Projects/GnomeFlashback), Regolith sidesteps
much of the complexity of a typical `gnome-shell` based environment while providing
simple and consistent system management capabilities.
